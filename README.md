•	Create a Python script that allows a user to enter and submit a real (decimal) number. Check the input upon entry to determine if the input is numeric. Continue to prompt for input until a number is entered. Display the result when ceil, floor, and round functions are applied to that number. Test your code with a variety of real numbers.

•	Create a python script that allows a user to enter a date with the format YYYY-MM-DD. Calculate and display the number of days between the date entered and June 30, 2018.

•	Create a python script that allows a user to enter two numbers. After the numbers are entered (and verified). Create 4 functions (addThem, subtractThem, multiplyThem, and divideThem) that accepts both variables, does the appropriate mathematic operation, and sends the result back to the program. Call each function in your program and display the result of the function calls using the following format: x plus y is result, x minus y is result2, etc...
